// Given two sets of elements, find the sum of all distinct elements from the sets.
// Wich means, find the sum of all elements which are present in either of the given sets.
// Set 1 : [3, 1, 7, 9], Set 2: [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]
// Output: 13 (distinct elements 4, 7, 2)

// Declare the sets as arrays

set2 = [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]

// Initialize sum to zero
